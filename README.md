## Featured Projects
- **playwave**: With the company of [@Jan]() and [@Oscar]() we introduced ourselves into the app development on a java environment with an MP3 Player called [playwave]().
- **Copernic Alumni**: Together with [@AlexGarcia]() and [@AlexGomez]() we designed a program to help to keep contact between the alumni and the headmaster of their previous center [Copernic Alumni](https://gitlab.com/grup-3-erp-alumni/erp-alumni).
- **Sushi Go App**: Alongside [@Brandon](https://github.com/BrandonJimenez23) (team leader), [@Hugo](https://github.com/FirerKraken/), and [@Pol](https://github.com/PolNie), we have designed an application in Android Kotlin, [Sushi Go](https://github.com/PolNie/Sushi-Go-App). This application focuses on the geolocation of restaurants, their visualization, and categorization, aimed at direct interaction with the user. The purpose is to enable users to find the nearest and/or top-rated Asian cuisine restaurants, both nearby and in other cities.
